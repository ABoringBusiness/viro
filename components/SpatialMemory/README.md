# Spatial Memory for AR Assistant

This module will allow the AR Assistant to remember object placements and spatial information between sessions, creating a persistent AR experience.

## Planned Features

- Persistent storage of AR object placements
- Spatial mapping and scene understanding
- Environment recognition and recall
- Spatial anchors for precise object positioning
- Cross-session spatial consistency
- Multi-user spatial data sharing
- Spatial context for assistant interactions

## Implementation Details

The spatial memory will be implemented through:

1. Local storage for spatial data
2. Cloud synchronization for shared experiences
3. Spatial mapping using ARKit/ARCore
4. Environment feature detection and tracking
5. Spatial anchor management
6. Scene graph persistence
7. Spatial context awareness

## Core Functionality

### Spatial Persistence

- Save and restore object placements between sessions
- Maintain object properties (position, rotation, scale)
- Preserve object relationships and hierarchies
- Support for different persistence scopes (session, user, location)

### Environment Recognition

- Detect and remember key environmental features
- Recognize previously visited spaces
- Adapt to environmental changes
- Map spaces for improved placement accuracy

### Spatial Anchors

- Create and manage spatial anchors for precise positioning
- Support for platform-specific anchor systems (ARKit, ARCore)
- Cloud anchors for shared experiences
- Anchor persistence across sessions

### Spatial Context

- Associate assistant interactions with spatial locations
- Remember user preferences in different spaces
- Provide location-aware responses and behaviors
- Support for spatial triggers and events

## Technical Approach

### Spatial Data Storage

- Efficient serialization of spatial information
- Versioned storage for compatibility
- Incremental updates for large environments
- Compression for reduced storage footprint

### Spatial Mapping

- Use platform-specific spatial mapping capabilities
- Create lightweight mesh representations of environments
- Extract key features for environment recognition
- Optimize for mobile performance

### Anchor Management

- Abstract platform differences in anchor systems
- Provide consistent API across platforms
- Handle anchor resolution and tracking
- Manage anchor lifecycle and persistence

### Synchronization

- Efficient cloud synchronization of spatial data
- Conflict resolution for multi-user scenarios
- Delta updates for bandwidth optimization
- Background synchronization for seamless experience

## User Experience

- Seamless continuation of AR experiences
- Consistent object placement between sessions
- Improved assistant interactions with spatial context
- Natural references to previously placed objects

## Integration with Existing Modules

This feature will enhance all existing AR Assistant modules:

- AR Interaction: Add persistence to object placements
- Natural Language Understanding: Add spatial context to intents
- AR Assistant Character: Enable location-aware behaviors
- Speech Recognition/TTS: Add spatial awareness to interactions

## Timeline

The spatial memory will be implemented in phases:

1. Core infrastructure for spatial data persistence
2. Basic object placement memory
3. Environment recognition and mapping
4. Spatial anchor management
5. Cross-session persistence
6. Multi-user spatial sharing
7. Spatial context for assistant interactions
