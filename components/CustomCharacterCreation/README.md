# Custom Character Creation for AR Assistant

This module will provide tools for developers to create their own assistant characters, allowing for unique and branded AR assistants.

## Planned Features

- Character customization tools
- Animation system for custom characters
- Lip-sync support for speech
- Emotion and expression system
- Character asset management
- Runtime character switching
- Character template library

## Implementation Details

The custom character creation will be implemented through:

1. Character model import and optimization
2. Animation rigging and control system
3. Lip-sync mapping for speech
4. Expression and emotion blending
5. Asset management and loading
6. Character configuration system
7. Template library and examples

## Core Functionality

### Character Customization

- Import 3D models from common formats
- Customize appearance (colors, textures, accessories)
- Configure physical properties (size, proportions)
- Set up character-specific animations
- Define personality traits and behaviors

### Animation System

- Standard animation set (idle, listening, speaking, etc.)
- Custom animation support
- Animation blending and transitions
- Procedural animation capabilities
- Performance optimization for mobile

### Lip-Sync

- Automatic lip movement for speech
- Phoneme mapping for accurate lip positions
- Support for multiple languages
- Emotion influence on speech animation
- Customizable mouth shapes

### Emotion System

- Basic emotion set (happy, sad, surprised, etc.)
- Blended emotion states
- Contextual emotion triggers
- Facial expression animation
- Body language animation

### Asset Management

- Efficient asset loading and unloading
- Level-of-detail for performance
- Asset compression and optimization
- Runtime asset swapping
- Asset bundling and packaging

## Technical Approach

### Model Processing

- Automatic optimization for mobile performance
- Polygon reduction while preserving quality
- Texture atlas generation
- Normal map baking
- Rigging verification and fixing

### Animation Framework

- Keyframe animation support
- Skeletal animation system
- Blend shape support for facial expressions
- Animation state machine
- Event-based animation triggers

### Character Configuration

- JSON-based character definition
- Visual editor for character setup
- Runtime parameter adjustment
- Character presets and templates
- Inheritance and composition for character traits

### Performance Optimization

- Adaptive level-of-detail
- Animation simplification based on distance
- Texture streaming and caching
- Instanced rendering for shared elements
- Memory usage optimization

## User Experience

- Intuitive character creation tools
- Real-time preview of changes
- Seamless integration with AR Assistant
- Consistent behavior across different characters
- Smooth transitions between character states

## Integration with Existing Modules

This feature will enhance all existing AR Assistant modules:

- AR Assistant Character: Add custom character support
- Text-to-Speech: Connect speech to custom lip-sync
- Natural Language Understanding: Link intents to character emotions
- AR Interaction: Add character-specific interaction styles

## Timeline

The custom character creation will be implemented in phases:

1. Core character model and animation system
2. Lip-sync and speech integration
3. Emotion and expression system
4. Character asset management
5. Character configuration tools
6. Template library and examples
7. Documentation and tutorials
