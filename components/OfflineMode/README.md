# Offline Mode for AR Assistant

This module will enable core functionality of the AR Assistant without an internet connection, allowing users to interact with the assistant even when offline.

## Planned Features

- Offline speech recognition using on-device models
- Local text-to-speech synthesis
- On-device natural language understanding
- Cached responses and behaviors
- Local storage for user preferences and history
- Seamless online/offline transition
- Sync capabilities when connection is restored

## Implementation Details

The offline mode will be implemented through:

1. On-device speech recognition models
2. Compact text-to-speech engines
3. Lightweight NLU models for core intents
4. Local storage for assistant data
5. Connection state management
6. Sync mechanism for offline actions

## Core Functionality in Offline Mode

The following features will be available offline:

- Basic voice commands and responses
- Character animations and behaviors
- Object placement and manipulation
- Simple Q&A from cached knowledge
- User preference management
- History tracking

## Enhanced Functionality in Online Mode

These features will require an internet connection:

- Advanced speech recognition
- High-quality voice synthesis
- Complex natural language understanding
- Real-time information retrieval
- Cloud-based processing for complex tasks
- Model updates and improvements

## Technical Approach

### Speech Recognition

- Use TensorFlow Lite models for on-device speech recognition
- Support a limited but useful set of commands offline
- Implement fallback mechanisms for uncertain recognition

### Text-to-Speech

- Use compact TTS engines optimized for mobile devices
- Cache commonly used phrases and responses
- Support dynamic text generation with limited vocabulary

### Natural Language Understanding

- Use quantized NLU models for core intents
- Implement rule-based fallbacks for common commands
- Prioritize high-precision over recall for offline mode

### Data Management

- Implement efficient local storage for assistant data
- Use IndexedDB or SQLite for structured data
- Implement data versioning for sync purposes

### Connectivity Management

- Monitor network state changes
- Gracefully transition between online and offline modes
- Queue actions that require online processing

## User Experience

- Clear indication of offline mode status
- Transparent limitations communication
- Seamless transition between modes
- Consistent core experience regardless of connectivity

## Integration with Existing Modules

This feature will enhance all existing AR Assistant modules:

- Speech Recognition: Add offline recognition capabilities
- Text-to-Speech: Add local synthesis options
- Natural Language Understanding: Add on-device models
- AR Assistant Character: Ensure all animations work offline
- AR Interaction: Make core interactions available offline

## Timeline

The offline mode will be implemented in phases:

1. Core infrastructure for offline/online state management
2. On-device speech recognition for limited command set
3. Local text-to-speech for common responses
4. Lightweight NLU for core intents
5. Local storage and caching system
6. Sync mechanism for offline actions
7. Testing and optimization
