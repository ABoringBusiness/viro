# Multi-user Collaboration for AR Assistant

This module will enable shared AR experiences with multiple assistants, allowing users to collaborate in the same AR space.

## Planned Features

- Real-time synchronization of AR content
- Shared spatial understanding
- Multi-user presence awareness
- Collaborative object manipulation
- Assistant-to-assistant communication
- User identity and permissions management
- Session management for collaborative experiences

## Implementation Details

The multi-user collaboration will be implemented through:

1. Real-time networking infrastructure
2. Shared spatial anchors
3. User presence representation
4. Synchronized object state management
5. Collaborative interaction protocols
6. Assistant coordination mechanisms
7. Session and permission management

## Core Functionality

### Real-time Synchronization

- Efficient state synchronization between devices
- Delta updates for bandwidth optimization
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- Latency compensation techniques
- Reliable message delivery with fallbacks

### Shared Spatial Understanding

- Cloud anchors for shared reference points
- Spatial alignment between different devices
- Environment feature sharing
- Consistent coordinate systems
- Spatial calibration mechanisms

### Multi-user Presence

- Visual representation of other users
- Spatial audio for user communication
- Activity indicators and status sharing
- User identification and labeling
- Proximity awareness and interactions

### Collaborative Interactions

- Shared object manipulation
- Ownership and access control
- Turn-taking and concurrent editing
- Interaction history and playback
- Undo/redo across multiple users

### Assistant Coordination

- Assistant-to-assistant communication
- Task delegation between assistants
- Coordinated responses and actions
- Shared knowledge and context
- Hierarchical assistant relationships

## Technical Approach

### Networking

- WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
- Fallback to server-relayed communication
- Optimized protocols for AR data
- Adaptive quality based on network conditions
- Connection recovery mechanisms

### State Management

- Operational transforms for concurrent edits
- Distributed state with eventual consistency
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Versioned object states
- Efficient serialization formats

### User Management

- Authentication and authorization
- User profiles and preferences
- Presence management
- Session invitations and joining
- Permissions and role management

### Performance Optimization

- Prioritized updates based on relevance
- Level-of-detail adjustments for remote content
- Bandwidth and CPU usage throttling
- Background synchronization for non-critical data
- Efficient encoding of spatial information

## User Experience

- Seamless joining of shared experiences
- Clear indication of other users' presence and actions
- Natural collaborative interactions
- Consistent experience across devices
- Graceful handling of network issues

## Integration with Existing Modules

This feature will enhance all existing AR Assistant modules:

- AR Interaction: Add multi-user interaction capabilities
- Natural Language Understanding: Add collaboration-specific intents
- AR Assistant Character: Enable assistant-to-assistant interactions
- Spatial Memory: Extend to support shared spatial understanding

## Timeline

The multi-user collaboration will be implemented in phases:

1. Core networking infrastructure
2. Basic state synchronization
3. User presence representation
4. Shared object manipulation
5. Assistant coordination
6. Session management
7. Performance optimization and testing
