# Interactive AR Assistant Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for creating an interactive AR camera assistant that users can talk to. The assistant will be built on top of the Viro platform and will leverage ML Kit and other AI technologies to create a natural, conversational AR experience.

## Overview

The Interactive AR Assistant will be a virtual character that appears in AR, responds to voice commands, recognizes objects in the environment, and provides a natural conversational interface. It will combine AR visualization with speech recognition, natural language processing, and contextual awareness to create an immersive and helpful AR experience.

## Components

The development will be broken down into the following components, each implemented as a separate PR:

### 1. Speech Recognition Module

**Goal**: Enable the AR application to understand spoken user commands.

**Implementation**:
- Create a `ViroSpeechRecognition` module
- Support multiple speech recognition backends:
  - Google's Speech Recognition API
  - Apple's Speech Framework for iOS
  - On-device ML Kit Speech Recognition
- Provide a simple API for starting/stopping listening and receiving transcribed text
- Include language support for multiple languages
- Implement continuous listening mode with wake word detection

### 2. Text-to-Speech Module

**Goal**: Allow the AR assistant to speak back to users with natural-sounding voice.

**Implementation**:
- Create a `ViroTextToSpeech` module
- Support multiple text-to-speech backends:
  - Google's Text-to-Speech API
  - iOS AVSpeechSynthesizer
  - ML Kit's Text-to-Speech capabilities
- Provide voice selection options (gender, accent, language)
- Implement SSML support for more natural speech patterns
- Create events for speech start/end to enable lip-syncing

### 3. AR Assistant Character

**Goal**: Create a visually appealing and expressive 3D character to represent the assistant.

**Implementation**:
- Design a 3D character model with appropriate level of detail for mobile AR
- Implement a set of animations for different states:
  - Idle (with subtle variations)
  - Listening
  - Thinking
  - Speaking (with lip-sync capability)
  - Gesturing (pointing, waving, etc.)
- Create a `ViroARAssistantCharacter` component that manages the character's visual representation
- Implement a lip-syncing system that matches mouth movements to speech
- Add support for character customization (appearance, clothing, etc.)

### 4. Natural Language Understanding

**Goal**: Process and understand user commands and generate appropriate responses.

**Implementation**:
- Create a `ViroNaturalLanguageUnderstanding` module
- Support multiple NLU backends:
  - OpenAI's API for more advanced understanding
  - Google's Dialogflow
  - Custom intent recognition using ML Kit
- Implement a conversation management system to:
  - Track conversation context
  - Handle different types of user requests
  - Manage conversation flow
- Create a simple intent recognition system for common AR commands
- Support entity extraction for identifying objects, locations, etc.

### 5. AR Interaction Enhancement

**Goal**: Enable the assistant to interact with the environment and respond to user gestures.

**Implementation**:
- Integrate with the Object Detection module to:
  - Allow the assistant to recognize objects in the environment
  - Enable the assistant to comment on or interact with detected objects
  - Create context-aware responses based on what the camera sees
- Implement gesture recognition to:
  - Allow users to interact with the assistant through hand gestures
  - Enable the assistant to respond to physical cues
- Add spatial awareness for the assistant to understand its position relative to the environment
- Create a pointing system for the assistant to reference real-world objects

### 6. AR Assistant Core Component

**Goal**: Combine all the above modules into a cohesive AR assistant experience.

**Implementation**:
- Create a `ViroARAssistant` component that integrates:
  - AR scene setup
  - Speech recognition
  - NLU processing
  - Character animation
  - Response generation
  - Text-to-speech output
- Implement a conversation state machine to manage:
  - Idle state
  - Listening state
  - Processing state
  - Responding state
- Add environment awareness using:
  - Object Detection for recognizing items in view
  - AR plane detection for positioning the assistant
  - Lighting estimation for realistic rendering
- Create a simple API for developers to extend the assistant's capabilities

### 7. Demo Application

**Goal**: Showcase the capabilities of the Interactive AR Assistant.

**Implementation**:
- Build a sample app that demonstrates:
  - AR scene with the assistant character
  - Voice command interface
  - Object recognition demonstrations
  - Interactive tutorials
- Include example use cases:
  - Information queries ("What is that building?")
  - Navigation assistance ("Guide me to the nearest exit")
  - Object identification ("What am I looking at?")
  - AR content manipulation ("Place a virtual chair here")
- Create a developer guide for customizing and extending the assistant

## Timeline

Each component will be developed as a separate PR, with dependencies managed appropriately. The estimated timeline for each component is:

1. Speech Recognition Module: 2 weeks
2. Text-to-Speech Module: 2 weeks
3. AR Assistant Character: 3 weeks
4. Natural Language Understanding: 3 weeks
5. AR Interaction Enhancement: 2 weeks
6. AR Assistant Core Component: 3 weeks
7. Demo Application: 2 weeks

Total estimated timeline: 17 weeks (approximately 4 months)

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: The assistant should run smoothly on modern mobile devices without excessive battery drain or heating.
- **Privacy**: Speech processing should respect user privacy, with options for on-device processing where possible.
- **Extensibility**: The architecture should allow developers to easily extend the assistant's capabilities.
- **Cross-platform**: The implementation should work consistently on both iOS and Android.
- **Accessibility**: The assistant should be usable by people with different abilities, including options for text input/output.

## Conclusion

The Interactive AR Assistant will provide a powerful new way for users to interact with AR applications through natural conversation. By breaking down the development into manageable components, we can iteratively build and test each piece of functionality before integrating them into the complete assistant experience.
